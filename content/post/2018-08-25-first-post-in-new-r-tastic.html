<p>OK, it had to happen and here it is: I moved my <a href="https://kkulma.github.io/">old r-tastic blog</a> to <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> and I’m not going to look back :) There are numerous resources that will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>highlight the advantages of using <code>blogdown</code> with <code>Hugo</code> over other static site generators, such as <a href="https://shiring.github.io/blogging/2016/12/04/diy_your_own_blog">Jekyll</a> (my previous choice)</p></li>
<li><p>explain how to set everything up (there are some excellent resources <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/">here</a>, <a href="https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/">here</a> or <a href="https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/">here</a>) or</p></li>
<li><p>deploy your site (e.g. using <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/">GitHub Pages</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>better than me, so I’m not going to dwell on it here. If I was to give some advice on approaching <code>blogdown</code>, though, it would be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>read <a href="https://yihui.name/en/about/">Yihui Xie</a>’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">e-book</a> before you read anything else - it gives a great overview of what <code>blogdown</code> is and how it works and even recommends a worflow to get you started :)</p></li>
<li><p>think carefully about choosing your theme: naturally, the way it looks is important, but even more critical are good documentation and ongoing meintanance. I spent good 3-4 hours playing with different themes and the one I eventually chose - <a href="https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn">blackburn</a> - was not the one I liked most, but the one that worked for me best.</p></li>
<li><p>if you get lost, simply pick a <code>blogdown</code> blog that you like and compare its layout/structure with what you see on the author’s GitHub page. Alternatively, you can create a separate <code>blogdown</code> project with included example posts and refer to that when building your own site.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>To finish off: <a href="https://kkulma.github.io/">old r-tastic blog</a> is still available at its old address, but with time I’ll try to migrate as many posts from there to here.</p>
<p>New <code>blogdown</code> site, new beginning! hope to see you here more often!</p>
