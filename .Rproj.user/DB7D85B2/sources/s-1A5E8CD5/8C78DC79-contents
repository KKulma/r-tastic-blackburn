OK, it had to happen and here it is: I moved my [old r-tastic blog](https://kkulma.github.io/) to [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and I'm not going to look back :) There are numerous resources that will:

- highlight the advantages of using `blogdown` with `Hugo` over other static site generators, such as [Jekyll](https://shiring.github.io/blogging/2016/12/04/diy_your_own_blog) (my previous choice) 

- explain how to set everything up (there are some excellent resources
[here](https://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/),
[here](https://tclavelle.github.io/blog/blogdown_github/) or [here](https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/)) or 

- deploy your site (e.g. using [Netlify](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) or [GitHub Pages](https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2018/02/r-blogdown-setup-in-github-2/))

better than me, so I'm not going to dwell on it here. 
If I was to give some advice on approaching `blogdown`, though, it would be:

1) read [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/)'s [e-book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) before you read anything else - it gives a great overview of what `blogdown` is and how it works and even recommends a worflow to get you started :) 

2) think carefully about choosing your theme: naturally, the way it looks is important, but even more critical are good documentation and ongoing meintanance. I spent good 3-4 hours playing with different themes and the one I eventually chose - [blackburn](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn) - was not the one I liked most, but the one that worked for me best.

3) if you get lost, simply pick a `blogdown` blog that you like and compare its layout/structure with what you see on the author's GitHub page. Alternatively, you can create a separate `blogdown` project with included example posts and refer to that when building your own site.

Hope this helps!

To finish off: [old r-tastic blog](https://kkulma.github.io/) is still available at its old address, but with time I'll try to migrate as many posts from there to here. 

New `blogdown` site, new beginning! hope to see you here more often!
