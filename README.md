# r-tastic web source

This is the source code for my [blog](https://r-tastic.co.uk/).

Made with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) 
(specifically [Blackburn theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/blackburn/)).

The source of my old site is [here](https://github.com/KKulma/kkulma.github.io) and the URL - [here](https://kkulma.github.io/).

Big thanks to [@maelle](https://github.com/maelle) whose blog description served as a template for this one! :)
