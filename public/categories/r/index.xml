      <description>Ho, ho, ho! It’s almost Christmas time and I don’t know about you, but I can’t wait for it! And what can be a better way of killing the waiting time (advent!) than participating in excellent Advent od Code. Big thanks to Colin Fay for telling me about it! It’s a series of coding riddles, one published every day between 1st and 25th of December. The riddles increase in difficulty level over time and they can be solved in any programming language, including R.</description>

      <title>Exploring London Crime with R heat maps</title>

      <description>Recently, I had a real pleasure to work with various types of data pulled from public APIs, one of them being data.police.uk API. Oh, those hours of pure intellectual exploration it’s given me! I have a soft spot for crime data and I explored it using heat maps in the past. Apart from checking and visualising stats for the new area in London we just moved to, it made me think more about good and better ways of presenting complex and multidimensional information.</description>

      <description>OK, it had to happen and here it is: I moved my old r-tastic blog to blogdown and I’m not going to look back :) There are numerous resources that will:
 highlight the advantages of using blogdown with Hugo over other static site generators, such as Jekyll (my previous choice)
 explain how to set everything up (there are some excellent resources here, here or here) or
 deploy your site (e.</description>

      <title>Prime hints for running a data project in R</title>

      <description>I’ve been asked more and more for hints and best practices when working with R. It can be a daunting task, depending on how deep or specialised you want to be. So I tried to keep it as balanced as I could and mentioned point that definitely helped me in the last couple of years. Finally, there’s lots (and I mean, LOTS) of good advice out there that you should definitely check out - see some examples in the Quick Reference section below.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing/talking a lot about LIME recently: in this blog/ at H20 meetup, or at coming AI Congress and I&amp;rsquo;m still sooo impressed by this tool for interpreting any, even black-box, algorithm! The part I love most is that LIME can be applied to both image and text data, that was well showcased in husky VS wolf (image) and Christian VS atheist (text) examples in the original publication. Thomas Lin Pedersen did an amazing job building lime package for R with excellent documentation and vignette.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s worth making New Year resolutions&amp;hellip; A year ago I made one for 2017 to start an R blog using RMarkdown and Jekyll static sites. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know git that well, had no clue what static sites are and was mostly oblivious to the rich and vibrant R community on Twitter. Fast-forward one year and&amp;hellip; the picture couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any more different! I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on writing this blog (and data science blog in general) and how it taught me about getting stuff done.</description>

      <title>Star Wars Vs Star Trek Word Battle</title>

      <description>It will go without saying that I’m super excited about the premiere of another Star Wars movie and I’m not an exception. This, together with with Piotr Migdal’s challenge posted on Data Science PL group on Facebook where he suggested comparing word frequencies between two different sources. It didn’t take me long to decide what source to choose! So in this short kand sweer blogpost I’m comparing word frequencies between two movie scripts: “Star Wars: The New Hope” (1977) and “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” (1979).</description>

      <description>I get bored from doing two things: i) spot-checking + optimising parameters of my predictive models and ii) reading about how &amp;lsquo;black box&amp;rsquo; machine learning (particularly deep learning) models are and how little we can do to better understand how they learn (or not learn, for example when they take a panda bear for a vulture!). In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll test a) H2O&amp;rsquo;s function h2o.automl() that may help me automate the former and b) Thomas Lin Pedersen&amp;rsquo;s library(lime) that may help clarify the latter.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered whether the most active/popular R-twitterers are virtual friends? :) And by friends here I simply mean mutual followers on Twitter. In this post, I score and pick top 30 #rstats twitter users and analyse their Twitter friends&amp;rsquo; network. You&amp;rsquo;ll see a lot of applications of rtweet and ggraph packages, as well as a very useful twist using purrr library, so let&amp;rsquo;s begin!

      <title>Animated Plots As Part Of Exploratory Data Analysis</title>

      <description>The internet seems to be booming with blog posts on animated graphs, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for more serious purposes or not so much. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think anything more of it than just a gimmick or a cool way of spicing up your conference talk. However, I&amp;rsquo;m a total convert now and in this post I want to show a real value that such graph can add to your (absolutely serious!) exploratory analysis.</description>
