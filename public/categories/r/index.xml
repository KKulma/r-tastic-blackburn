      <description>Recently, I had a real pleasure to work with various types of data pulled from public APIs, one of them being data.police.uk API. Oh, those hours of pure intellectual exploration it’s given me! I have a soft spot for crime data and I explored it using heat maps in the past. Apart from checking and visualising stats for the new area in London we just moved to, it made me think more about good and better ways of presenting complex and multidimensional information.</description>

      <description>OK, it had to happen and here it is: I moved my old r-tastic blog to blogdown and I’m not going to look back :) There are numerous resources that will:
 highlight the advantages of using blogdown with Hugo over other static site generators, such as Jekyll (my previous choice)
 explain how to set everything up (there are some excellent resources here, here or here) or
 deploy your site (e.</description>

      <description>It’s a very quick post on how to get a list of datasets available from within R with their basic description (what package they can be found in, number of observations and variables). It always takes me some time to find the right dataset to showcase whatever process or method I’m working with, so this was really to make my life easier. So! I’m going to scrape the table with a list of R datasets from here using rvest and xml2 packages:</description>

      <description>In the last month I discovered two things that changed my life: audiobooks and Yuval Harari. The former completely transformed my daily commute, the latter changed the way I think about the surrounding world (with more appreciation for history and politics, to say the least). The cocktail of the two made my brain cells sing.
Harari published two books in the last three years: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and more recently: Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.</description>

      <title>Did Disney Princesses distort girl names in USA?</title>

      <description>My goal is to analyse how frequency of names found among Disney female characters changed over time in the US. Specifically, I want to see if the movie release had any impact on their popularity. For this purpose, I will use babynames dataset that is available on CRAN.
The idea for the exercise was inspired by Sean Kross’ blog post
Short description of the dataset from CRAN package description
The SSA baby names data comes from social security number (SSN) applications.</description>
