<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s worth making New Year resolutions&hellip; A year ago I made one for 2017 to start an R blog using RMarkdown and Jekyll static sites. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t even know git that well, had no clue what static sites are and was mostly oblivious to the rich and vibrant R community on Twitter. Fast-forward one year and&hellip; the picture couldn&rsquo;t be any more different! I&rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on writing this blog (and data science blog in general) and how it taught me about getting stuff done. But I can&rsquo;t write all this without mentioning a very special group of people - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&amp;src=typd">#rstats community</a>! - that is now a big part of everything that gets published here.</p>

<h4 id="on-getting-stuff-done"><strong>ON GETTING STUFF DONE</strong></h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m a list-person. Totally. I love ticking off boxes, feeling that I&rsquo;ve achieved a lot every day. At the same time, working full time in London (meaning work + non-negligible commute) while having two small children (2 and 4 years old) leaves me with very little spare time (usually in the evenings). Fortunately, my work as a data scientist and this blog give me lots of opportunities to solve problems and deliver something tangible in defined time frames. Here are some rules that I&rsquo;ve learned in the last months and years that I try to apply whenever I can in my data projects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>stay focused and clear - know what you want to achieve and by when. Be ambitious, yet realistic (lists and internal deadlines really help!).</p></li>

<li><p>Learn to recognise when you&rsquo;re delving into the literature that is irrelevant to the project (just because it&rsquo;s interesting or may be useful in the future) and leave it for when the project is finished or when it can be directly applied to it.</p></li>

<li><p>If you want to explore an <em>&ldquo;alternative solution&rdquo;</em> (for whatever reason: it may be more efficient, elegant, creative, etc.), give yourself a time limit by the end of which you&rsquo;ll drop it and look for other alternatives (if you still aren&rsquo;t any closer to achieving your goal). It&rsquo;s surprising and embarrassing how many times I got stuck at something thinking it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the best way&rdquo;, just to discover later better and quicker solutions.</p></li>

<li><p>If you&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to do something (using trial &amp; error + Stack Overflow + Google) and you&rsquo;re not successful after 30 minutes, post your question on Twitter/Stack Overflow. Seriously, not only are you likely to get the correct answer within 5-30 minutes, but also you&rsquo;ll learn several different ways to approach your problem. Also, you&rsquo;ll save yourself a significant amount of time and frustration&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p>I said that <a href="https://kkulma.github.io/2017-08-13-friendships-among-top-r-twitterers/">before</a>, but&hellip; don&rsquo;t be a perfectionist. Your learning is never finished and there will be always something you could add or do better if you only knew about X, Y, Z at the time. So let it go and get stuff out. People&rsquo;s feedback can only help and point you in the right direction once your project has been published. Also, being part of R community can guarantee you that this feedback will never be cruel or personal.</p></li>

<li><p>If things take longer than you&rsquo;d like to, is there a way to break them up? Writing two shorter posts instead of one? Presenting a method/package rather than a finished analysis?</p></li>

<li><p>The last but definitely not the least: no number of ticked-off boxes on the to-do list will ever replace relationships. Now even if I have a plan to finish a project in the evening, but my partner comes home late and we hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to catch up yet, I drop the project and spend the evening chatting with him. For some people it&rsquo;s a no-brainer but I had to learn that data projects cannot compromise relationships that have been and will be supporting us for life.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="r-community-is-like-no-other"><strong>R COMMUNITY IS LIKE NO OTHER</strong></h4>

<p>That&rsquo;s probably the most important lesson of 2017 - the R community is the most supportive and open community I&rsquo;ve ever seen and been part of. Something absolutely critical that they made me realise is that <strong>the best and most popular R community members are so (not only) because they have great skills and produce great work, consistently. They are so because they spend a considerable amount of time and energy on acknowledging other people&rsquo;s great work</strong>.</p>

<p>There are some people that particularly contributed to this view this year and I want to help them here for that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ma_salmon">Maelle</a> for support, encouragement but also great efficiency and content of <a href="http://www.masalmon.eu/">her blog</a>. Maelle always is one of the first people to comment on my blog posts and give me great advice on new methods/packages. We still haven&rsquo;t met offline, but I already feel like I know her a little bit :)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">Mara</a> for shamelessly promoting great work of others <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/10/rprofile-mara-averick/">while working on 135482629 projects at any given time&hellip;</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShirinGlander">Shirin</a> - Shirin is just this really impressive data scientist who knows so much and can convey this knowledge in any of her <a href="https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/">various blog posts</a>. I learn a lot from her!</p></li>

<li><p>supportive connections can sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes, e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/d4tagirl">Daniela</a> was always a super enthusiastic #rstats Twitterer and commented on my tweets sometimes. And clearly that was enough to convince her husband to help me solve <a href="https://twitter.com/KKulma/status/899382021767737344">really annoying issues with Jekyll and htmlwidgets</a>. BTW, Daniela is a great <a href="https://d4tagirl.com/">blogger</a> and a <a href="https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/">NASA Datanuat</a>!</p></li>

<li><p>R ladies from London, particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/hfcfrick">Hannah Frick</a>, Grace Mayer and <a href="https://twitter.com/clavitolo">Claudia Vitolo</a> who go far beyond what&rsquo;s expected from any volunteers and meetup organisers!</p></li>

<li><p>There are several female figures in R community who work at the forefront of R and Data Science and yet openly talk about <em>progress</em> everyone makes when learning any programming language (or skill, for that matter) and that no one is born a master. I&rsquo;m grateful for those messages particularly to:</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JennyBryan">Jenny Bryan</a> who is a master of <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/12/08/rprofile-jenny-bryan/">workflow and life logistics</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/juliasilge">Julia Silge</a> who writes excellent <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/authors/juliasilge/">blog posts on Stack Overflow data findings</a> and dresses up in <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/juliasilge">DataCamp courses</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CVWickham">Charlotte Wickham</a> who gave a great presentation on <a href="http://cwick.co.nz/talks/collab-code-user17/#/">collaborative coding</a> and how EVERYONE can contribute to R community</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-a-year"><strong>WHAT A YEAR</strong></h4>

<p>2017 was absolutely mind-blowing for me. I started this year not being at all confident in my coding or data science skills, I&rsquo;m finishing it writing a semi-successful R blog, co-organizing R-ladies meetups in London, getting invited to give DS talks at meetups and conferences and definitely feeling that I&rsquo;m part of R community. Most importantly, my learning rate has gone through the roof and it doesn&rsquo;t look it will be stopping anytime soon :) Thanks everyone for this year, it wouldn&rsquo;t happen without you!</p>
