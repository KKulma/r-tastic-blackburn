<p>Recently, I had a real pleasure to work with various types of data pulled from public APIs, one of them being <a href="https://data.police.uk/">data.police.uk API</a>. Oh, those hours of pure intellectual exploration it’s given me! I have a soft spot for crime data and <a href="https://kkulma.github.io/2017-05-30-animated-plots-as-part-of-exploratory-data-analysis/">I explored it using heat maps in the past</a>. Apart from checking and visualising stats for the new area in London we just moved to, it made me think more about good and better ways of presenting complex and multidimensional information. I’m dedicating this post to my favourite heat maps, so expect some lovely colours (side by side with insightful findings on London crime)!</p>
<div id="project-description" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Project description</strong></h2>
<p>I’m going to scrape Wikipedia to get coordinates of all Tube Stations in London. Then I’ll pick a random sample of 20 of them and use their latitude and longitude to pull all crime information for those locations between Jan 2016 and June 2018. Then, I’ll explore crime frequency and crime type per location over time using faceted heatmaps. Finally, I play a bit with <code>leaflet</code> package to explore best way of visualising this data on geographical heat maps.</p>
</div>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Packages</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s a sweet collection of packages required to run this analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(httr)
library(rvest)
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(jsonlite)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(viridis)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(htmltools)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="scraping-wiki" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Scraping Wiki</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s first start with scraping a table from Wikipedia website that holds coordinates for all London Tube stations. I used Google Selector tool for it, you can learn more about it <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/">here</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### scraping with rvest() ####

<p>First thing done. Now, it would take a stupid amount of data to pull all the crime information for extended periods of time for ALL of the Tube stations, so let’s pick a sample of 20 places instead and take it from there:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># pick only coordinates and a station name from Wikipedia table
wiki_selected &lt;- 
  wiki_tbl %&gt;% 
  select(name = Name,
         lat = Latitude,
         long = Longitude)

# pick a random sample of 20 Tube stations
set.seed(999)
k &lt;- sample(as.numeric(rownames(wiki_selected)), 20)
wiki_sample &lt;- wiki_selected[k, ]
wiki_sample</code></pre>

<div id="pulling-data-from-data.police.uk-api" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Pulling data from <strong>data.police.uk</strong> API</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we have coordinates, we can feed them into the UK Police API that requires the following parameters: latitude, longitude and year-month which we want to pull crime data for. To make everyone’s life easier, I define a function <code>get_crime()</code> which will require all three parameters but also a name of the station that coordinates correspond to:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_crime &lt;- function(lat, long, date, name) {
  # pull specified data from the API 
  base &lt;- &quot;https://data.police.uk/api/crimes-street/all-crime&quot;
  police_url &lt;- paste0(base, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;lat=&quot;, lat, &quot;&amp;lng=&quot;, long, &quot;&amp;date=&quot;, date)  
  get_police &lt;- GET(police_url)
  
  # parse JSON file into a clean data frame
  police_data_json &lt;- content(get_police, &quot;text&quot;)
  police_data &lt;- fromJSON(police_data_json, flatten = TRUE) %&gt;% 
    mutate(location = name)
  
  return(police_data)
  
}</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. However, our brand new <code>get_crime()</code> function can pull data only for a single location and a single month. Let’s use it in the <code>for loop</code> together with amazing <code>pmap()</code> function from <code>purrr</code> package to get all the data we need. <strong>WARNING</strong>: the code below needs good 15 minutes to run, so think twice before you execute it!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create a series of months that we want data for
iter_months &lt;- str_sub(seq(ymd(&#39;2016-01-01&#39;), ymd(&#39;2018-06-20&#39;),
                           by = &#39;month&#39;),
                       start = 1, end = 7)

# pull data from API for all the locations over all the months
final_df&lt;-data.frame()
for(i in 1:length(iter_months)){
  # result will be a list
  pre_final_list &lt;- pmap(list(lat = wiki_sample$lat,
                              long = wiki_sample$long,
                              name = wiki_sample$name,
                              date = iter_months[i]),
                         get_crime)
  # turn a list of locations in one month into a data.frame
  pre_final_df &lt;- bind_rows(pre_final_list) 
  # put all the clean data.frames together
  final_df &lt;- bind_rows(final_df, pre_final_df)
  
}</code></pre>

<p>Oh, yes we did!</p>
<p>Let’s finish off with some minor data cleaning: API returns coordinates for crimes, but not for the original location of interest (Tube station), let’s fix it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>final_df &lt;- final_df %&gt;% 
    left_join(wiki_sample, by = c(&quot;location&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) %&gt;%
    rename(date = month,
         search_lat = lat,
         search_long = long)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, for some heat maps, all time data will be too much to handle. In those cases I’ll focus on one month only, July 2017, and I pick only random 10% of it, to make interactive maps more responsive:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>july_data &lt;- final_df %&gt;%
  filter(date == &quot;2017-07&quot;) %&gt;% 
  sample_frac(.1)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="heat-mapping" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Heat-mapping</strong></h2>
<p><strong>FACETED HEAT MAPS</strong></p>
<p>Here come the heat maps! Let’s start summarising the frequency of all crimes for each location and month:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># summarise available data and save it in a data.frame
police_grid &lt;- final_df %&gt;%
  unique() %&gt;% 
  group_by(location, date) %&gt;% 
  summarise(n_crimes = n())

### faceted heat map of all the crimes per location and month!
ggplot(police_grid,aes(x=date,y=location, fill=n_crimes))+
  #add border white colour of line thickness 0.25
  geom_tile(colour=&quot;white&quot;,size=0.25)+
  labs(x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;&quot;)+
  #remove extra space
  scale_y_discrete(expand=c(0,0))+
  #define new breaks on x-axis
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0,0), 
                   breaks=c(&quot;2016-01&quot;,&quot;2017-01&quot;,&quot;2018-01&quot;))+

<p>So pretty! I’m a big-big fan of <code>viridis</code> colour pallette and I must say you see it at its best in heat maps. And how informative this heat map is! From the first glimpse you can see straight away which areas tend to have more crime (e.g. Bethnal Green, Bayswater) and when (summer months). We know what and when, what about the type of crime they experiene most? This can be sorted with another faceted heatmap:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># summarise data by location and crime type
crime_grid &lt;- final_df %&gt;% 
  group_by(location, category) %&gt;% 
  summarise(n_crimes = n()) 

# plot above data in faceted heat map
ggplot(crime_grid,aes(x=category,y=location, fill=n_crimes))+
  geom_tile(colour=&quot;white&quot;,size=0.25)+
  labs(x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;&quot;)+
  scale_y_discrete(expand=c(0,0))+
  scale_fill_viridis(option = &quot;B&quot;) +
  coord_fixed()+
  theme_grey(base_size=8)+
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    axis.text=element_text(face=&quot;bold&quot;),
    axis.ticks=element_line(size=0.4),
    plot.background=element_blank(),
    panel.border=element_blank()
  ) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Number of crimes&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-08-26-exploring-london-crime-with-r-heat-maps_files/figure-html/tiled-heatmap2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Another informative beauty! You can see that 3 types of crime dominate: anit-social behaviour, violent crime and vehicle theft. Again, avoid Bethnal Green if you can and make sure you hang out in Epping, instead!</p>
<p><em>GEOGRAPHIC HEAT MAPS</em></p>
<p>Facets are brilliant when it comes to quantitative comparison, but where are these areas? are they close/far away from each other? These questions can be only answered by geo heat maps. Lets plot a very basic one using <code>leaflet</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>july_data %&gt;% 
  leaflet() %&gt;%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %&gt;%
  addHeatmap(lng=~as.numeric(location.longitude),
             lat=~as.numeric(location.latitude),
             radius = 8)</code></pre>

<p>Great, it looks like the farther away you are from the city centre, the fewer crimes you see (doh!). Now, we can add information about number of plotted crime-points using <code>clusterOptions</code> functionality, have a look:</p>

<p>That makes comparison a bit more solid and quantifiable. Great! But still, it’s difficult to understand, for example, how areas with the highest crime rate relate to each other. There’s a solution for it! First, let’s pick 3 areas with the most crimes:</p>

<p>Good. Now, let’s try something new: create two types of icons and associate the top three areas with one of them. Again, <code>leaflet</code> package makes it very easy to make icons from any open source PNG files:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### marker icons ####

# URL to PNG files
tube_icon &lt;- &#39;https://www.shareicon.net/data/128x128/2016/02/02/712554_shapes_512x512.png&#39;
police_icon &lt;- &#39;https://png.icons8.com/metro/1600/policeman-male.png&#39;

# create one icon for top 3 areas and one for the rest
policeIcons &lt;- icons(
  iconUrl = ifelse(july_data$location %in% top_3$location,
                   police_icon,
                   tube_icon),
  iconWidth = 30, iconHeight = 30
)

# plot the heatmap with the icons
july_data %&gt;% 
  leaflet() %&gt;%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %&gt;%
  addMarkers(lng = ~as.numeric(search_long),
             lat = ~as.numeric(search_lat),
             label = ~location,
             icon = policeIcons) %&gt;% 
  addHeatmap(lng=~as.numeric(location.longitude),
             lat=~as.numeric(location.latitude),
             radius = 8)</code></pre>
