      <description>I stopped caring about the estimates that ocassionally ride the internet about how much time data scientists spend on data wrangling VS modelling. The answer is: probably a lot and likely more than originally planned (probably indicating here dependency on the state and richness of input data and the intended application for it, ekhem).
Still, the right tools can go a long way in achieving a desired result in the time frame that can surprise even the most optiomistic of us.</description>

      <description>There’s no time to lose, so here comes another Advent of Code puzzle solved using R. Day 5 challenge, here we come! What are we expected to do?
The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are destroyed. Units’ types are represented by letters; units’ polarity is represented by capitalization.</description>

      <description>After some wonderful Christmas and New Year’s distractions, now it’s time to continue with my Advent of Code challenges in R (before the summer comes…).
To avoid waffling, the 4th puzzle offers a record of guards’ shifts with various activities plus the time they started and time. We need to gather two things from this dataset:
Which guard sleeps most (minutes) andWhat minute does that guard spend asleep the most?</description>

      <description>Here we are, ending yet another year and starting something new. I wanted to take a minute to dwell on 2018, what happened in my R world this year and reflexions I take from that.
public speakingThis year started for me with a bang - as a result of my presentation about LIME at one of H2O meetups (of which YouTube video has now reached unthinkable 11K views!) I was invited to speak at various events - be it AI Congress, LSE’s Python Group or Data Science Festival.</description>

      <description>Ho, ho, ho, Happy Chris.. New Year? Between eating the sea of fish (as the Polish tradition requires), assembling doll houses and designing a new kitchen, I finally managed to publish the third post on My R take on Advent of Code. To keep things short and sweet, here’s the original challenge:

      <description>This is my second blog post from the series of My R take on Advent of Code. If you’d like to know more about Advent of Code, check out the first post from the series or simply go to their website. Below you’ll find the challnge from Day 2 and the solution that worked for me. As always, feel free to leave comments if you have different ideas on how this could have been solved!</description>

      <description>Ho, ho, ho! It’s almost Christmas time and I don’t know about you, but I can’t wait for it! And what can be a better way of killing the waiting time (advent!) than participating in excellent Advent od Code. Big thanks to Colin Fay for telling me about it! It’s a series of coding riddles, one published every day between 1st and 25th of December. The riddles increase in difficulty level over time and they can be solved in any programming language, including R.</description>

      <description>Recently, I had a real pleasure to work with various types of data pulled from public APIs, one of them being data.police.uk API. Oh, those hours of pure intellectual exploration it’s given me! I have a soft spot for crime data and I explored it using heat maps in the past. Apart from checking and visualising stats for the new area in London we just moved to, it made me think more about good and better ways of presenting complex and multidimensional information.</description>

      <description>OK, it had to happen and here it is: I moved my old r-tastic blog to blogdown and I’m not going to look back :) There are numerous resources that will:
highlight the advantages of using blogdown with Hugo over other static site generators, such as Jekyll (my previous choice)
explain how to set everything up (there are some excellent resources here, here or here) or
deploy your site (e.</description>

      <description>I’ve been asked more and more for hints and best practices when working with R. It can be a daunting task, depending on how deep or specialised you want to be. So I tried to keep it as balanced as I could and mentioned point that definitely helped me in the last couple of years. Finally, there’s lots (and I mean, LOTS) of good advice out there that you should definitely check out - see some examples in the Quick Reference section below.</description>
