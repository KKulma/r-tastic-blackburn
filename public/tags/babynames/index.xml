      <description>My goal is to analyse how frequency of names found among Disney female characters changed over time in the US. Specifically, I want to see if the movie release had any impact on their popularity. For this purpose, I will use babynames dataset that is available on CRAN.
The idea for the exercise was inspired by Sean Krossâ€™ blog post
