      <description>I’ve been asked more and more for hints and best practices when working with R. It can be a daunting task, depending on how deep or specialised you want to be. So I tried to keep it as balanced as I could and mentioned point that definitely helped me in the last couple of years. Finally, there’s lots (and I mean, LOTS) of good advice out there that you should definitely check out - see some examples in the Quick Reference section below.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s worth making New Year resolutions&amp;hellip; A year ago I made one for 2017 to start an R blog using RMarkdown and Jekyll static sites. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know git that well, had no clue what static sites are and was mostly oblivious to the rich and vibrant R community on Twitter. Fast-forward one year and&amp;hellip; the picture couldn&amp;rsquo;t be any more different! I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my thoughts on writing this blog (and data science blog in general) and how it taught me about getting stuff done.</description>
