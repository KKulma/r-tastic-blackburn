      <description>Recently, I worked a bit with cluster analysis: the common method in unsupervised learning that uses datasets without labeled responses to draw inferences. I wanted to put my notes together and write it all down before I forget it, thus the blog post. For the start, I’ll tackle multiple approaches to how to determine the number of clusters in your data.
QUICK INTRO Clustering algorithms aim to establish a structure of your data and assign a cluster/segment to each datapoint based on the input data.</description>
