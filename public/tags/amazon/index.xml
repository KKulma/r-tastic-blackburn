      <description>In the last month I discovered two things that changed my life: audiobooks and Yuval Harari. The former completely transformed my daily commute, the latter changed the way I think about the surrounding world (with more appreciation for history and politics, to say the least). The cocktail of the two made my brain cells sing.
Harari published two books in the last three years: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and more recently: Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.</description>
