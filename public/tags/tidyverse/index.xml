      <description>I stopped caring about the estimates that ocassionally ride the internet about how much time data scientists spend on data wrangling VS modelling. The answer is: probably a lot and likely more than originally planned (probably indicating here dependency on the state and richness of input data and the intended application for it, ekhem).
Still, the right tools can go a long way in achieving a desired result in the time frame that can surprise even the most optiomistic of us.</description>

      <description>After some wonderful Christmas and New Year’s distractions, now it’s time to continue with my Advent of Code challenges in R (before the summer comes…).
To avoid waffling, the 4th puzzle offers a record of guards’ shifts with various activities plus the time they started and time. We need to gather two things from this dataset:
Which guard sleeps most (minutes) andWhat minute does that guard spend asleep the most?</description>

Between eating the sea of fish (as the Polish tradition requires), assembling doll houses and designing a new kitchen, I finally managed to publish the third post on My R take on Advent of Code. To keep things short and sweet, here’s the original challenge:
Each Elf has made a claim about which area of fabric would be ideal for Santa’s suit.</description>

      <description>Ho, ho, ho! It’s almost Christmas time and I don’t know about you, but I can’t wait for it! And what can be a better way of killing the waiting time (advent!) than participating in excellent Advent od Code. Big thanks to Colin Fay for telling me about it! It’s a series of coding riddles, one published every day between 1st and 25th of December. The riddles increase in difficulty level over time and they can be solved in any programming language, including R.</description>
